	<long_description>Xyzzy is a homebrew application that allows the extraction of the OTP and SEEPROM Encryption Keys.

This modified version uses full hardware access through the HW_AHBPROT flag to read the both OTP and SEEPROM chips, copy their data to a memory buffer and retrieve the console keys. Thus, it no longer installs a modified IOS11 nor uses PatchMii.

Other changes include:

* Compatibility with USB devices.
* Support for GCN controllers and newer WiiMotes.</long_description>
